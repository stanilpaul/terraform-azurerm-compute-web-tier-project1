# Compute web tier

This module simulate a module would be created by the infrastructure/VM team for an architecture.
In this module, we will use to create NIC, Vms, datadisks.

This is a very easy architecture but we will try to simulate real time IT team working and collaboration with good practice.

Here I use the `for_each` as much as possible.
