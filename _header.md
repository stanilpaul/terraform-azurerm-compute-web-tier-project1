# Compute web tier

This module simulates one that would be created by the Infrastructure/VM team for an architecture.
In this module, we will use Terraform to create NICs, VMs, and data disks.

Although this is a simple architecture, we aim to simulate real-time IT team workflows and collaboration following best practices.

Here I use the `for_each` as much as possible.
